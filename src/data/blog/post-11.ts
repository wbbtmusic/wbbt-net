                Here is the uncomfortable truth: <strong>Most publicists are scammers.</strong> 
                <br><br>
                They have the same email list you can find on Google, and they blast it with zero personalization using Mailchimp. 
                They promise "exposure" but deliver a placement on a blog with 12 monthly visitors. And they charge you $3,000 a month for the privilege.
                <br><br>
                In 2026, PR is not about "Mass Emailing"; it is about <strong>Relationship Architecture</strong>. 
                You can build a press campaign yourself that outperforms an agency, IF you understand how journalists actually work.

                Journalists are lazy (and overworked). They don't want to be the <em>first</em> person to discover you; it's too risky. 
                They want to know that *someone else* likes you before they commit. You need to build a pyramid of approval.

                Platform like Submithub are tools, not saviors. 
                <strong>The Trap:</strong> Many curators on these sites are burnt out and just want the $2 fee. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Hack:</strong> Look at the "Approval Rate" before you submit. 
                If a blog approves 50% of songs, they are a bot farm or they have no standards. Their support means nothing.
                <br>
                If they approve <strong>2% to 5%</strong>, they are legit. Only submit to the picky ones. A rejection from a real human is better than acceptance from a bot. 
                Real curation spreads. Fake curation dies.
