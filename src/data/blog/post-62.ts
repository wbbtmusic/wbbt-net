      <p class="lead">In 2026, the algorithm is more volatile than ever. One day you're up, the next you're invisible. The smartest artists are opting out of the "attention economy" and building their own "connection economy." It's not about reaching millions; it's about deeply impacting hundreds.</p>

      <h2>The Shifting Landscape: Reach vs. Retention</h2>
      <p>For the last decade, the music industry was obsessed with "Reach." How many people saw your TikTok? How many playlist adds did you get? But in 2026, those numbers are increasingly hollow. <strong>Retention</strong> is the new currency.</p>

      <h2>The "100 True Fans" 2.0 Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>Kevin Kelly's famous "1,000 True Fans" theory has evolved. You don't even need a thousand anymore. With high-ticket offers and direct-to-fan sales, 100 die-hard supporters can fund your next album.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-200">
            Indie band <em>Lunar Kids</em> had 4,000 monthly listeners on Spotify but couldn't sell tickets. They switched strategy:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 text-gray-200">
            <li>Stopped posting generic "stream my song" stories.</li>
            <li>Started a "Secret Society" Discord (invite-only).</li>
            <li>Dropped a "members-only" merch line (50 units).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="font-bold text-green-400">Result: $2,500 net profit in 24 hours. More than 1 million streams would have paid them.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-400">Create a Discord server or a dedicated Telegram channel. Set up a simple "Welcome" bot. Don't overcomplicate channels; "General" and "Announcements" are enough.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="flex">

                <p class="text-gray-400">Personally DM your top 20 engagers on Instagram. Don't post a public story yet. Say: "Hey, I'm starting a private group for my closest listeners to share demos. Want in?"</p>

        </div>

                <p class="text-gray-400">Upload a demo that isn't on Spotify. Ask for feedback on the mix. Make them feel like <em>producers</em>, not just consumers.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-400">Now post on socials. Share a screenshot of the community having fun. "My Discord heard this track 2 weeks ago. Join now for the next one." FOMO is powerful.</p>
