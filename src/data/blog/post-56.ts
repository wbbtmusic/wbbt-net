                The music industry is uniquely designed to make you feel inadequate. 
                Spotify numbers are public. Follower counts are public. Chart positions are public.
                Imagine if every time you walked into an office, everyone's salary and "Performance Review" was tattooed on their forehead. 
                That is the music industry.
                <br><br>
                To survive 2026 without quitting, you don't need better plugins. You need a mental operating system upgrade. You need <strong>Stoicism</strong>.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. The "Gap" Trap (Why Success Feels Like Failure)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                You have 10,000 streams. You feel great.
                <br>Then you see a 16-year-old on Instagram with 1,000,000 streams. Suddenly, your 10,000 streams feel like failure. You feel "behind."
                <br><br>
                This is because you are measuring the <strong>Gap</strong> between where you are and "The Ideal."
                The Ideal is a horizon. As you walk towards it, it moves away. If you get 1 million streams, the "Ideal" will become 10 million. You will NEVER reach it.
            </p>
            
            <div class="bg-teal-900/20 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-teal-500/30 mb-12">
                <h4 class="text-teal-400 font-bold text-2xl mb-4">The Solution: Measure the Gain</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg">
                    Turn around 180 degrees. Stop looking forward. Look backward.
                    <br><br>
                    "Two years ago, I didn't know how to use a Compressor. Now I do."
                    <br>"Last year, I had 0 streams. Now I have 10,000."
                    <br><br>
                    That is the <strong>Gain</strong>. Measuring the Gain produces dopamine and confidence. Measuring the Gap produces cortisol and anxiety.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. Jealousy as a Compass</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                We are taught that jealousy is bad. No. Jealousy is <strong>Data</strong>.
                <br>When you feel a pang of jealousy towards another artist, do not suppress it. Examine it. It is telling you what you truly want.
                <br><br>
                Are you jealous of their money? 
                <br>Or are you jealous of their <em>freedom</em> to tour?
                <br>Are you jealous of their fame?
                <br>Or are you jealous of the <em>respect</em> they get from peers?
                <br><br>
                Use the jealousy to define your true goals. 
                "I don't actually want his pop fame, I just want his studio budget."
                Okay, now you have a goal: Get a bigger budget. Now you can work on that.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Ed Sheeran once said that songwriting is like a dirty tap in an old house. 
                You have to run the water for 5 minutes (brown, dirty water) before it runs clear.
                <br><br>
                You have 100 bad songs inside you. You must get them out to get to the good ones.
                Stop trying to make every song a masterpiece. 
                <strong>Action Item:</strong> Challenge yourself to finish 5 "Bad Songs" this week. Intentionally bad. 
                You will be surprised; by removing the pressure of "Good," you might accidentally write your best work.
