    <p>Getting your music on Spotify and Apple Music used to cost a fortune. Today, you can <strong>Sell Your Music Online</strong> for free. Literally $0.</p>

    <p>But in the music industry, there is an old saying: <em>"If you aren't paying for the product, you are the product."</em></p>

    <p>This article reviews the <strong>Best Music Distributor 2026</strong> options, exposes the hidden fees, and helps you decide if you need a <strong>DistroKid Alternative</strong> or a real partner.</p>

    <h2>Top Free Distribution Platforms (2026 List)</h2>

    <h3>1. Amuse (The "Keep 100% Royalties" Choice)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Good:</strong> Very popular. A slick mobile app. You <strong>Keep 100% of Royalties</strong> on the free tier.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> Release times are slow (4 weeks on free tier). If you need <strong>Unlimited Music Releases</strong> quickly, you're out of luck.</p>

    <h3>2. SoundOn (TikTok Distribution)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Good:</strong> Integrated directly with TikTok. Great for viral potential and <strong>TikTok Music Promotion</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> It's a commission model. They take a cut. And you are locking yourself into the TikTok ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>3. FreshTunes (Budget Option)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Good:</strong> True 100% royalties. No fees.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> The interface is dated. "Extra" services like promotion are pushed heavily.</p>

    <h3>4. Unchained Music (Web3 Challenger)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Good:</strong> The new kids on the block using Web3 tech to lower costs. 100% royalties.</p>
    <p><strong>The Bad:</strong> Less proven track record than the giants like <strong>TuneCore</strong> or <strong>CD Baby</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Hidden Cost of "Free"</h2>
    <p>Why do these companies let you upload for free? Because they are banking on two things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Upsells:</strong> They will charge you for things that should be standard like YouTube Content ID, quicker support, or adding a second artist.</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> They want to find the next big star.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed Throttling:</strong> Free releases often sit in "review" for 3-4 weeks. In <strong>Independent Music Marketing</strong>, timing is everything.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Distributor vs. Record Label: What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>This is the most important distinction you need to understand.</p>

    <p>A <strong>Distributor</strong> (like Amuse or DistroKid) is a <strong>logistics company</strong>. They are a truck. They move your file from Point A (your computer) to Point B (Spotify). If your song gets 0 streams, the truck driver doesn't care. They did their job.</p>

    <p>A <strong>Record Label</strong> (like WBBT Records) is a <strong>partner</strong>. We are the co-pilot. If your song gets 0 streams, we failed. We have skin in the game.</p>

    <h3>Why Choose WBBT Records?</h3>
    <p>We combine the tech of a modern distributor with the heart of an indie label.</p>
