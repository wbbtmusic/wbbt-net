                Avicii. Mac Miller. Chester Bennington. The list of artists lost to the pressures of the industry is a tragedy that keeps repeating. 
                The music industry flatters you with dopamine, then abandons you in isolation. 
                Burnout is not a sign of weakness; it is a structural hazard of the job. 
                This is not a motivational post. This is a survival protocol.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. The Dopamine Crash (Science)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                On tour, you are a god. Every night at 9 PM, thousands of people scream your name. Your brain floods with dopamine and adrenaline (Level 10).
                <br>Then you go home. You sit on your couch in silence. The stimulation drops to Level 2.
                <br><br>
                Your brain perceives this drop as a catastrophe. It feels like grief. 
                <br><strong>The Protocol:</strong> Do not go cold turkey.
                <br>Schedule high-activity social events for the week you return. Exercise heavily (endorphins). Taper the stimulation down slowly.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. Social Media Dysmorphia</h2>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-gray-700 mb-12">
                <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg mb-6">
                    You are comparing your <strong>Internal Reality</strong> (Insecurity, Debt, Fatigue) with your peers' <strong>External Highlight Reel</strong> (Sold out shows, Champagne).
                </p>
                <div class="bg-black/50 p-6 rounded-2xl border-l-4 border-rose-500">

                    <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-400">
                        <li><strong>1. Create before Consume:</strong> Never scroll TikTok before you have done 30 mins of creative work.</li>
                        <li><strong>2. Greyscale Mode:</strong> Turn your phone screen Black & White. It stops the slot-machine effect.</li>
                        <li><strong>3. The "Burner" Feed:</strong> Create an account that only follows Gardening, Cooking, or Architecture. Use this to relax.</li>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. The Civilian Anchor</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                As you get bigger, your circle fills with "Yes Men" and people on your payroll.
                They will never tell you the truth because they want to keep their jobs.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Identify one friend who knew you *before* the fame. Someone who is a plumber, a nurse, or a teacher.
                Give them permission to roast you.
                When you start acting like a diva, you need someone to say, "Shut up and pass the ketchup." That ground you.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">4. Identity Separation</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                The most dangerous trap is tying your Self-Worth to your Numbers.
                <br>If the graph goes up, you are happy. If the graph goes down, you are depressed.
                <br><br>
                You must build a <strong>Safe Harbor</strong>.
                <br>Pick a hobby where you are a "Beginner" and where rank doesn't matter. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Pottery. Hiking.
                When the music career is storming, retreat to the harbor where you are just a human being.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">5. The "No" Muscle</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Early in your career, you say YES to everything to get exposure.
                Later in your career, YES is a cancer.
                <br>Every YES to a collab you don't like is a NO to your own mental peace.
                <br><strong>The Test:</strong> If it's not a "Hell Yes," it's a "No." 
                Guard your energy. It is your most expensive asset.
            </p>
