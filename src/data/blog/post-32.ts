                Max Martin is not a magician. He is a mathematician. 
                The Swedish songwriter has written more #1 hits than The Beatles or Michael Jackson. 
                He treats music not as an abstract art, but as a rigid science of psychology and acoustics. 
                Here is the "Melodic Math" formula anyone can use.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. Melody is King, Lyrics are Servants</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                In the Max Martin school, the syllable count and phonetic sound of a word matter more than the dictionary definition.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Rule:</strong> If a clever lyric messes up the rhythm of the melody, <strong>delete the lyric</strong>.

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                    Ed Sheeran initially wrote: "And my bedsheets smell like <strong>Top Note Perfume</strong>."
                    <br>It was too wordy. It didn't flow.
                </p>

                    <p class="text-green-300 italic">"And my bedsheets smell like <strong>YOU.</strong>"</p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-4">
                    Simplification. Open Vowel ("Oooo"). 
                    It resonates better in a stadium than "Perfume" (Closed mouth sound).
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. The "Mirror Effect" (Symmetry)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Human brains love patterns. We love balance. Max Martin songs are perfectly balanced equations.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. The "Chorus First" Arrangement</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                In the TikTok era, you do not have 30 seconds to "build the mood." You have 3 seconds.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Strategy:</strong> Start the song with the Chorus (or a "Tease" of the Chorus).
                <br>The Beatles did this ("She Loves You"). 
                If the hook is the best part, why hide it at 0:45? Put it at 0:00.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">4. K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Complex chords are for Jazz musicians. Simple chords are for the world.
                <br><br>
                Max Martin rarely uses more than 4 chords. 
                But he makes them interesting with <strong>Inversions</strong> and <strong>Voice Leading</strong>. 
                Using C Major is fine. Playing C Major like a toddler is not.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">5. The "Grand Finale" Rule</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                The last chorus must be the biggest. 
                Add a high harmony. Add ad-libs. Double the hi-hats. 
                Leave the listener on a high, so they hit "Replay" immediately. 
                A flat ending is a forgotten song.
