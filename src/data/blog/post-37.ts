                The number one cause of lawsuits in the music industry is not copyright infringement; it is <strong>undefined splits</strong>. 
                You write a song with a friend. It blows up. Suddenly, that "friend" remembers writing 50% of the lyrics, when you know they only changed one word. 
                Without a paper trail, you are doomed. This guide explains how to handle the uncomfortable conversation like a professional.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. The Golden Rule: "In the Room, On the Paper"</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Do not wait until the song is mixed. Do not wait until release day.
                The moment the session ends, sends the text.
            </p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 font-mono text-sm bg-black/30 p-4 rounded-lg">
                    "Yo! Fire session today. Just to confirm the splits for registration before I forget:
                    <br><br>
                    - Me: 50%
                    <br>- You: 50%
                    <br><br>
                    Everyone good with that? Reply with a thumbs up so I can file it."
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm mt-4 italic">
                    When they reply "👍", screenshot it. Save it to a Google Drive folder called "Legal." 
                    That screenshot holds up in court.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. The "Nashville Split" (The Peacekeeper)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                In Nashville, they don't count lines or chords. They count bodies.
                <br><strong>The Rule:</strong> If you are in the room when the song is written, you get an equal cut.
                <br><br>
                - 2 People = 50/50.
                - 3 People = 33/33/33.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> Because fighting over who wrote the bridge kills the vibe. 
                If you fight over 5%, that person will never work with you again. 
                A relationship (that creates 10 songs) is worth more than 10% of one song.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. The Producer Debate</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                 "I just made the beat, do I get publishing?"
                 <br><strong>YES.</strong>
                 <br><br>
                 In Hip-Hop and Pop, the track *is* the song. The melody is often dictated by the chords and rhythm. 
                 Standard industry practice is <strong>50% to the Track (Producer)</strong> and <strong>50% to the Topline (Lyricist/Singer)</strong>.
                 Don't be the rapper who tries to give the producer 0%. You will get blacklisted.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">4. Samples = Loss of Equity</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                If you sample a Marvin Gaye song, you don't own 100% of your song anymore.
                The Marvin Gaye Estate might demand 50% off the top.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The Math:</strong>
                <br>- Total Pie: 100%
                <br>- Sample Owner takes: 50%
                <br>- Remaining Pie: 50%
                <br>- You and your co-writer split the remaining 50% (So you get 25% each).
                <br><br>
                Always clear samples *before* you negotiate your own splits.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">5. The "Black Box" of Splits</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                If you register the song as 50/50, but your co-writer registers it as 60/40, the PRO (ASCAP/BMI) freezes the money.
                They put it in a holding account (The Black Box). 
                If you don't resolve the dispute in ~3 years, the money is lost forever. 
                <strong>Communicate. Confirm. Collect.</strong>
