                        <span><strong>Shares > Likes:</strong> In 2026, the "Share" is the only metric that causes virality. If a user doesn't send your video to a DM group, the algorithm assumes it's passive content and kills it.</span>

                        <span><strong>Visual Loops:</strong> Create a video that loops perfectly. If the viewer watches it twice without realizing, your retention score doubles, signaling the algorithm to push it to the 'For You' page.</span>

                You posted a great song. It got 200 views. You blamed the time of day. You blamed the hashtags. You blamed "shadowbanning."
                <br><br>
                Here is the harsh truth: <strong>The algorithm does not care about your music.</strong> The algorithm is a math equation designed to keep users on the app for as long as possible. It is a <em>Dopamine Casino</em>. 
                <br><br>
                If your video keeps people watching, it wins. If it doesn't, it dies. 
                In 2026, the barrier to entry is higher than ever. To blow up today, you don't need to be just a musician; you need to be an expert in <em>Retention Editing</em>.

                TikTok counts "Retention" as a percentage. If your video is 15 seconds and they watch 15 seconds, that is 100%.

                <br>Getting a 200% retention score is a guaranteed viral trigger.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                <strong>How to do it:</strong> Make the end of your video sentence flow perfectly into the start of the video.
                <br><em>End of video sentence:</em> "...and that is the main reason why..."
                <br><em>Start of video sentence:</em> "...you are failing at music."
                <br><br>
