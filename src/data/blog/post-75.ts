    content: `
    <p>Every day, our A&R team listens to hundreds of demos. Most of them are deleted in 10 seconds.</p>
    <p>Why? Not because the music is bad. But because the approach is wrong.</p>
    <p>If you want to <strong>Get Signed to a Record Label</strong> in 2026, you need to stop acting like an amateur and start acting like a partner.</p>

    <h2>1. The "10-Second Rule" of Demo Submission</h2>
    <p>A&Rs are busy. We don't have time to wait for a 45-second intro.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't</strong> send a WeTransfer link that expires.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't</strong> send a private SoundCloud link that needs a password we have to ask for.</li>
        <li><strong>DO</strong> send a direct, streaming link (SoundCloud or Dropbox).</li>
        <li><strong>DO</strong> get to the hook immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Numbers vs. Potential</h2>
    <p>There is a myth that you need 100k followers to get signed. This is false.</p>
    <p>At <strong>WBBT Records</strong>, we sign <strong>Potential</strong>. We look for unique sound design, a cohesive visual brand, and a drive to succeed.</p>
    <p>If you have 1,000 true fans and a killer sound, you are more valuable than an artist with 50k bots.</p>

    <h2>3. Stop "Mass Emailing" Labels</h2>
    <p>We know when you BCC 50 labels in one email. It goes straight to spam.</p>
    <p>Research the label. Do they release your genre? Do they have a vibe you fit into?</p>
    <p><em>"Hey WBBT, I love what you did with [Artist Name]'s recent release..."</em> goes a long way.</p>

    <h2>4. The "Vibe" Check</h2>
    <p>We sign people, not just songs. Are you easy to work with? Do you have a vision?</p>
    <p>When you <strong>Submit Music to Labels</strong>, you are proposing a business partnership. Be professional. Be kind. Be ready to work.</p>
