                Rihanna is a billionaire. Jay-Z is a billionaire. Dr. Dre is a billionaire. 
                <br>Did they get there by selling albums? No. 
                <br>They used music as a <strong>Customer Acquisition Channel</strong> for higher-margin businesses (Fenty, Roc Nation, Beats).
                The days of "Music as the Product" are over. Here is the Wealth Ladder you must climb.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. Level 1: Selling Music (The Poverty Trap)</h2>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
                <div>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg">
                        <strong>Product:</strong> Streams, Downloads.
                        <br><strong>Margin:</strong> Extremely Low.
                        <br>Spotify pays $0.003/stream. You are competing with 100,000 new songs a day. You have zero leverage. You are an employee of the algorithm.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-red-900/10 border border-red-500/20 p-6 rounded-2xl flex items-center justify-center">

            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. Level 2: Selling Time (The Job)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                <strong>Product:</strong> Touring, VIP, Cameo.
                <br><strong>Margin:</strong> Medium.
                <br>This is better. You keep more money. But it is not scalable. If you get sick, the money stops. You are trading hours for dollars.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. Level 3: Selling Goods (The Business)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                <strong>Product:</strong> Hoodies, Vinyl, Hats.
                <br><strong>Margin:</strong> High (300%).
                <br>Now you are an E-Commerce brand. Music is the "Content Marketing" that drives traffic to your store.

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    Don't keep the store open 24/7. That's boring.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>The Weeknd's Method:</strong>
                    <br>1. Open store on Friday at 9AM.
                    <br>2. Close store on Sunday at 9PM.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Result:</strong> Urgent buying behavior. "If I don't buy it now, it's gone." This doubles conversion rates.

                        What does your fan <em>do</em> while listening to your music?
                        <br>- <strong>Lofi Producer?</strong> Your fans study. Sell "Nootropic Coffee" or "Blue Light Glasses."
                        <br>- <strong>Metal Band?</strong> Your fans play guitar. Sell a custom "Distortion Pedal."
                        <br>- <strong>Country Singer?</strong> Your fans BBQ. Sell "Hot Sauce."

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Stop asking "How do I get more streams?"
                Start asking "What problem can I solve for the people who already stream my music?"
                <br>That is the difference between a starving artist and a CEO.
