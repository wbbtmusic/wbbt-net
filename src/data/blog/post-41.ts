                Sync Licensing (placing your music in TV, Film, and Ads) is the last bastion of the "Big Check" in the music industry. 
                A single placement in a Netflix show can pay $5,000 to $20,000 up front. 
                But it is a closed door. Supervisors receive 500 emails a day. 
                This guide mimics the exact workflow of top Sync Agencies to help you pick the lock.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. The Sync Mindset</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                When you write for yourself, you are the Main Character. 
                When you write for Sync, the <strong>Scene</strong> is the Main Character.
                <br>Your music is wallpaper. It needs to support the emotion without distracting from the dialogue.
                <br><br>
                <strong>The "Universal" Lyric Rule:</strong>
                <br>Avoid proper nouns. Don't say "I was in Paris in 2024." 
                <br>Say "I was lost in the city." 
                <br>This allows the song to work in a movie set in Paris, Tokyo, or New York. It increases your "Sellable Surface Area."
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">2. The "One-Stop" Advantage</h2>
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-gray-700 mb-12">
                <h5 class="text-white font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Scenario A: Major Label Artist</h5>
                <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">Supervisor wants a Beyonce song. They have to call Sony (Master), Warner Chappell (Publishing), and Beyonce's lawyer. It takes 3 weeks and costs $100k.</p>
                <div class="w-full h-px bg-gray-600 my-6"></div>
                <h5 class="text-green-400 font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Scenario B: You (One-Stop)</h5>
                <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">Supervisor wants your song. They email you. You say "I own 100% of Master and Publishing." You sign the PDF in 5 minutes. The deal is done.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 font-bold mt-4">
                    Speed > Fame. 
                    <br>TV productions move fast. Being "Easy to Clear" is your biggest competitive advantage.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">3. The Metadata Trinity</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                If I download your MP3 and put it in my iTunes, and I love it, but I can't find your email... you lost the deal.
                <br>You MUST allow your contact info to travel <em>with</em> the file.
            </p>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl border-l-4 border-violet-500 mb-12">
                <h5 class="text-white font-bold mb-4">Required MP3 ID3 Tags</h5>
                <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-300 font-mono text-sm">
                    <li><strong>Artist:</strong> Your Name</li>
                    <li><strong>Title:</strong> Song Name (feat. X)</li>
                    <li><strong>Album:</strong> Contact: your@email.com</li>
                    <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Moods: Dark, Gritty, Tension</li>
                    <li><strong>Composer:</strong> First Last (PRO# 123456)</li>
                    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> One-Stop. 100% Controlled. Lyrics about: winning, fighting.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">4. What to Send (The Folder)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Never attach files to an email. Supervisors hate that.
                Send a link (DISCO.ac, Box.com, Dropbox).
                <br><strong>The Folder Structure:</strong>
                <br>1. Main Mix (WAV + MP3 320kbps)
                <br>2. Instrumental (CRITICAL. Use this for dialogue scenes).
                <br>3. Clean Mix (No swearing).
                <br>4. Stems (Drums, Bass, etc. for editing).
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">5. How to Find Supervisors</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                <strong>Tunefind.com:</strong> Look up your favorite show. See who the "Music Supervisor" is.
                <br><strong>IMDbPro:</strong> Find their email.
                <br><strong>The Pitch:</strong> "Subject: One-Stop Indie Pop // For Fans of Billie Eilish.
                <br>Hi [Name], loved your work on [Show]. Here is a playlist of One-Stop tracks for your consideration. Best, [You]."
                <br>Short. Sweet. Professional.
