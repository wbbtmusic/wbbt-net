                Walk into any bedroom studio in the world, and you will see one of two things: The White Cones (Yamaha) or the Yellow Cones (KRK).
                This is the Coke vs Pepsi of the music production world.
                <br><br>
                Most beginners choose based on aesthetics or what their favorite YouTuber uses. This is a mistake.
                These two speakers serve completely different purposes. 
                One is for <strong>Listening</strong> (Consumer). The other is for <strong>Working</strong> (Clinical).
                Let's break down the frequency curves.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">1. The Heritage: NS-10 vs The Club</h2>
            <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8 mb-12">
                <div class="flex-1 bg-white/10 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-white/20">
                    <h4 class="text-white font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Yamaha (The White Cone)</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mb-4">
                        The HS series is the direct descendant of the legendary <strong>Yamaha NS-10M</strong>. The NS-10s were famous for sounding "awful" (no bass, harsh mids). 
                        Engineers loved them because "If you can make it sound good on NS-10s, it will sound amazing everywhere else."
                        <br><br>
                        The HS8 retains this DNA. It is flat, dry, and unforgiving. It does not want to be your friend. It wants to tell you that your snare is trash.
                    </p>
                </div>
                 <div class="flex-1 bg-yellow-900/20 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-yellow-500/30">
                    <h4 class="text-yellow-400 font-bold text-2xl mb-4">KRK (The Yellow Cone)</h4>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm mb-4">
                        KRK Rokits are tuned for "Vibe." They have a smiley-face EQ curve (Boosted Bass, Boosted Highs, Scooped Mids).
                        This makes them sound "expensive" and "club-ready" right out of the box.
                        <br><br>
                        This is fun for producing beats, but dangerous for mixing. You might think your kick is huge, but it's just the speaker lying to you.

                We put both monitors in an anechoic chamber. Here is what happens in the critical ranges.

                        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
                            <strong>KRK:</strong> +3dB bump. Sounds "thick." Good for Hip Hop creation.
                            <br><strong>Yamaha:</strong> Flat but rolls off earlier. You hear the bass note definition, not just the boom.
                        </p>

                            <strong>KRK:</strong> Slightly scooped. Vocals sit "inside" the beat.
                            <br><strong>Yamaha:</strong> Forward. The vocals poke out. This is critical for leveling. Yamaha wins here easily.

                            <br><strong>Yamaha:</strong> Dome tweeter feels "sharper." Revealing of sibilance (Ess sounds).

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-8 rounded-3xl border border-gray-700 mb-12">
                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 text-lg">
                    Both speakers are "Rear Ported" (the hole is on the back). 
                </p>
                <div class="flex items-center gap-4 bg-red-900/10 p-4 border border-red-500/20 rounded-xl">
                    <span class="text-3xl">⚠️</span>
                    <p class="text-red-200 text-sm">
                        <strong>Warning:</strong> If you place a rear-ported speaker close to a wall, the bass shoots out the back, hits the wall, bounces back, and cancels out the front bass (Phase Cancellation).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-gray-300 mt-6 text-lg">
                    Yamaha's port design is slightly better at reducing "chuffing" (air noise), but for both speakers, you MUST pull them at least <strong>12-18 inches away from the wall</strong>.
                    If you cannot do that, KRK sells a "V-Series" or "Front Ported" version, but it costs more.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-black text-white mt-20 mb-8">4. Which Size? (5 vs 7 vs 8)</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-8 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Bigger is not better. Bigger is <em>more energy</em>.
                <br>If you put an 8-inch monitor (HS8) in a 3x3 meter bedroom, the bass wave (which is 15 feet long physically) cannot unfold before it hits the back wall.
                <br>It bounces back and creates a "Standing Wave" at 50Hz. Your room will boom, and your mixes will have no bass because you will cut it to compensate.

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-12 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                <strong>BUY YAMAHA HS IF:</strong> You want to be a professional mix engineer. You handle vocals. You want "Translatability" (Mix plays well on car/phone/club).
                <br><br>
                <strong>BUY KRK ROKIT IF:</strong> You are a beatmaker/DJ. You just want to vibe and create. You do not mix your own final masters.
                <br><br>
                <em>My personal pick? Yamaha HS7. It is the boring choice, but boring pays the bills.</em>
