    <p class="lead">We see it every day. An artist gets 1 million views on a TikTok video. They think they made it. They pop the champagne.</p>
    <p>Two weeks later? Profound silence. The streams drop. The comments stop. The algorithm has moved on to the next trend, and they are left with nothing but a "viral moment" that didn't convert.</p>
    <p>In 2026, <strong>Virality is a drug. Community is food.</strong> You can't survive on a sugar high.</p>

    <h2>The "Rentals" vs. "Owners" Mindset</h2>
    <p>When you rely on TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts to give you views, you are <strong>renting</strong> your audience. You don't own the data. You don't own the contact list. TikTok can change the algorithm tomorrow (and they will), and your reach goes to zero.</p>
    <p>When you build an email list, a Discord server, or a simplified SMS text community, you <strong>own</strong> that relationship. Mark Zuckerberg can't take away your email list.</p>

    <h3>The 2026 Funnel:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Top of Funnel (Attention):</strong> TikTok/Reels (Viral Reach)</li>
        <li><strong>Middle of Funnel (Connection):</strong> Spotify/YouTube (Listening)</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom of Funnel (Ownership):</strong> Discord/Email/SMS (Super Fans)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Micro-Economies are the New Major Labels</h2>
    <p>Stop trying to be Drake. You don't need millions of passive fans. You need a Micro-Economy of active investors.</p>
    <p>Let's do the actual math of an independent artist in 2026:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scenario A (Streaming):</strong> 1 million streams on Spotify ≈ $4,000 (One-time payout). Hard to replicate.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenario B (Community):</strong> 1,000 fans paying $10 a month on Patreon/Substack = <strong>$10,000/month</strong> ($120,000/year). Recurring revenue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you see the difference? Engagement pays better than exposure. 1,000 true fans are worth more than 1 million passive scrollers.</p>

    <h2>How WBBT Records Helps You Build</h2>
    <p>We aren't just an upload button. We help you execute the <strong>"Waterfall Release Strategy"</strong>.</p>
    <p>The #1 way to kill a community is silence. If you disappear for 6 months to "work on an album," your fans will forget you.</p>
    <p>Our <strong>Unlimited Free Releases</strong> model allows you to drop singles consistently (every 4-6 weeks). This keeps you:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Top of Mind:</strong> Fans see your name every month.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Friendly:</strong> Spotify loves consistency and rewards frequent uploads with algorithmic placement.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Rich:</strong> Every release gives you more data points to understand who your fans effectively are.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Action Plan for 2026</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Post Shorts Daily:</strong> Use them only to drive traffic to your bio.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Capture Data:</strong> Give away a free demo, a sample pack, or early access in exchange for an email or phone number.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Release Monthly:</strong> Use WBBT Records to distribute a new single every 4 weeks. Keep the momentum alive.</p>
    <p>4. <strong>Nurture the Core:</strong> Spend 80% of your time talking to the 20% of fans who actually buy your merch.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Stop chasing the lottery ticket of virality. Start building the house of community.</p>
    <p>Release your music with WBBT, keep your royalties, and invest that saved distribution money back into your fans.</p>
